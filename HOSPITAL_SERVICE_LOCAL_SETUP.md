# Hospital Service - Local Development Setup

## 🎉 Success! Hospital Service is Running Locally

The Hospital Service has been successfully implemented and is now running locally at `http://localhost:3003`. Here's what we've accomplished:

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. **Hospital Service (Standalone Mode)**
- **Status**: ✅ Running successfully on port 3003
- **Mode**: Standalone (no external dependencies required)
- **Data Storage**: In-memory (perfect for testing)

### 2. **API Endpoints**
All endpoints are functional and tested:

- **Health Check**: `GET /api/v1/hospitals/health`
  - Returns service status and version info
  - ✅ Tested and working

- **Register Hospital**: `POST /api/v1/hospitals`
  - Accepts hospital registration data
  - Returns hospital ID and status
  - ✅ Tested and working

- **Get All Hospitals**: `GET /api/v1/hospitals`
  - Returns list of all registered hospitals
  - ✅ Tested and working

- **Get Hospital Details**: `GET /api/v1/hospitals/{id}`
  - Returns specific hospital information
  - ✅ Tested and working

### 3. **Test Results**
```
🏥 Testing Hospital Service (Standalone Mode)...

✅ Health check passed
✅ Hospital registration successful
✅ Get hospital details successful  
✅ Get all hospitals successful (Found 2 hospitals)

🎉 Hospital Service testing completed!
```

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Quick Start
```bash
cd services/hospital-service
npm run start:standalone
```

### Environment Variables (Optional)
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3003

ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001
```

### Test the Service
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3003/api/v1/hospitals/health

# Register a hospital
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/v1/hospitals \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
